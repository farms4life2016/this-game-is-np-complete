# This Game is NP-Complete

An attempt to create a game in Unity that is NP-Complete. 
I was inspired by *LaserTank*, [which was proved to be NP-Complete](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05966), despite the creator probably not intending to create a NP-Complete game.
As such, I wanted to create a game that is also NP-Complete despite not seemingly so.

I don't intend to provide the proof of NP-Completeness within the game; it shall be left as an exercise for the reader. ~~It would also make a good thesis for my CS degree, right?~~
